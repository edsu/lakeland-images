McCampbell,True,,"Edwin A. Newman and Clara Newman originally purchased the property located at 5400 Cleveland Avenue on Block 45-Lot 6.  The property was transferred to Enos Newman on November 19, 1894.  Seven Years later, in 1901, Enos Newman of Rippen Hanover, Montgomery Pennsylvania, transfers the deed to Bessie Newman.

In 1935 the property was “taken from” Bessie Newman by the County Commissioner. On January 20, 1942, Cuban-born Marcelino Cordove of 1226 Girard Street, NW, Washington, DC, was granted the property.  Macelino Cordove, age 55, apparently purchased the property for $12,500.00 (1930 U.S. Census).  Marcelino is listed as “Head of Household” and lives with his wife, Mary F. Cordove who is 53 years old.  Their two daughters, Terisa, 27, and Evelyn Brown, 35, son Marcell, 25, and grandson Raymond, 14, also lived in the home listed on Girard Street (1930 U.S. Census).  So far there is no record that all family members moved to the residence on Cleveland Avenue on the east side of Lakeland.

According to an oral history, sited in the Lakeland Community Heritage Project's book “Images of America Lakeland African Americans in College Park,” the house was used by Marcelino Cordove as a family operated lodging business with modest “tourist homes” located adjacent to the house.

The 1930 U.S. Census lists Mr. Cordove and his wife’s race as Negro.  However, other documents list his wife as white (1900 U.S. Census).  

On March 3rd 1951 Marcelino Cordove transferred the deed to his relative Alexander S.C. Stant of 1627 Lamont Street, NW, Washington, D.C. for $10.00.  Also on that same day records indicate that the deed was transferred back over to Marcelino Cordove and Alberta C. Cordove. (www.mdlandrec.net)

In 1971, records show that Alberta C. Cordove relinquished the deed to Paul Parker, Jr. and Dolores E. Parker, C.W. Blomquist, Trustee, Diane K. Blomquist (Prince George’s County) and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission.  However, records indicate that on January 15th 1971 Alverta (Cordove) received an inheritance of the property from Marcelino Cordove (d. 10/23/71).

Six years later on January 25, 1977, Paul Parker, Jr. and Delores E. Parker transferred the property to the City of College Park. The property was subsequently condemned.

As of September 20, 1990, Prince George’s County lists the property under the City of College Park, Maryland, Metro Book/Liber Number 7782, Folio 36.

Please note the following quoted from Prince George’s County, Maryland record; “I went through all the Grantee records for the County Commissioner hoping to find the deed, which gave them ownership of the property, but I couldn’t find it.  It is also not clear to me if the County Commissioner purchased the land or just received it because no one purchased it at auction.  ~ Margaret Prest” (www.mdlandrec.net)",No,

Newman and Clara Newman originally purchased the property located at 5400 Cleveland Avenue on Block 45-Lot 6.  The property was transferred to Enos Newman on November 19, 1894.  Seven Years later, in 1901, Enos Newman of Rippen Hanover, Montgomery Pennsylvania, transfers the deed to Bessie Newman.

In 1935 the property was “taken from” Bessie Newman by the County Commissioner. On January 20, 1942, Cuban-born Marcelino Cordove of 1226 Girard Street, NW, Washington, DC, was granted the property.  Macelino Cordove, age 55, apparently purchased the property for $12,500.00 (1930 U.S. Census).  Marcelino is listed as “Head of Household” and lives with his wife, Mary F. Cordove who is 53 years old.  Their two daughters, Terisa, 27, and Evelyn Brown, 35, son Marcell, 25, and grandson Raymond, 14, also lived in the home listed on Girard Street (1930 U.S. Census).  So far there is no record that all family members moved to the residence on Cleveland Avenue on the east side of Lakeland.

According to an oral history, sited in sited in the Lakeland Community Heritage Project's book “Images of America Lakeland African Americans in College Park,” the house was used by Marcelino Cordove as a family operated lodging business with modest “tourist homes” located adjacent to the house.

The 1930 U.S. Census lists Mr. Cordove and his wife’s race as Negro.  However, other documents list his wife as white (1900 U.S. Census).  

On March 3rd 1951 Marcelino Cordove transferred the deed to his relative Alexander S.C. Stant of 1627 Lamont Street, NW, Washington, D.C. for $10.00.  Also on that same day records indicate that the deed was transferred back over to Marcelino Cordove and Alberta C. Cordove. (www.mdlandrec.net)

In 1971, records show that Alberta C. Cordove relinquished the deed to Paul Parker, Jr. and Dolores E. Parker, C.W. Blomquist, Trustee, Diane K. Blomquist (Prince George’s County) and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission.  However, records indicate that on January 15th 1971 Alverta (Cordove) received an inheritance of the property from Marcelino Cordove (d. 10/23/71).

Six years later on January 25, 1977, Paul Parker, Jr. and Delores E. Parker transferred the property to the City of College Park. The property was subsequently condemned.

As of September 20, 1990, Prince George’s County lists the property under the City of College Park, Maryland, Metro Book/Liber Number 7782, Folio 36.

Please note the following quoted from Prince George’s County, Maryland record; “I went through all the Grantee records for the County Commissioner hoping to find the deed, which gave them ownership of the property, but I couldn’t find it.  It is also not clear to me if the County Commissioner purchased the land or just received it because no one purchased it at auction.  ~ Margaret Prest” (www.mdlandrec.net)
